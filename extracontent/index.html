<h2 id="אתבש">אתבש</h2>
<p>Like Noekeon and ROT13, an involution.
About as secure as the latter.
Pronounced &ldquo;atbash&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<p>Cryptographic APIs have often been confusing and error-prone for
cryptographers, and impenetrable for mere mortals.
The situation considerably improved since the 2010s, thanks to libraries
such as NaCl (and its sister Sodium) and built-in language APIs such as
that of Go.</p>
<h2 id="arleas">ARLEAS</h2>
<p>Abuse resistant lawful enforcement access systems, or lawful
interception that cryptographers might live with, thanks to lossy
encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and a global immutable ledger.</p>
<p>The paper formalizing ARLEAS demonstrates thet &ldquo;cryptographic
implausibility&rdquo; of retrospective abuse-resistant interception, or access
to communication content that predates a warrant&rsquo;s issuance.
It&rsquo;s because this would require that all participants be at
any time potentially subject to interception.</p>

<h2 id="ate-pairing">Ate pairing</h2>
<p>The most efficient elliptic-curve pairing known.
Ate pairings are thus often used in practice, for example within BLS
signatures over BLS curves.</p>

<h2 id="avalanche">Avalanche</h2>
<p>Or avalanche effect, the quite archaic criteria that in a block cipher
or hash function all input bits should affect all output bits.
Like diffusion, this is less about cryptographic strength than
statistical randomness.</p>
<h2 id="bls-barreto-lynn-scott-curves">BLS (Barreto-Lynn-Scott) curves</h2>
<p>Elliptic curves created to make pairing operations secure and efficient,
due to the certain properties of the curve.
Such curves must have a subgroup with a high enough, yet
not enormous <em>embedding degree</em>, for pairings be efficiently computable.</p>
<p>BLS curves were designed with the Tate pairing in mind, but can also be
used to compute (optimal) Ate pairings, introduced six years after BLS
curves.</p>
<p>BLS curves have for example been used in zk-SNARK constructions, and in
BLS signatures, whose BLS is a different author set than that of the
curves.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="bls12-381">BLS12-381</h2>
<p>The most common BLS curve used in practice. 12 is the embedding degree
(and the degree of field extension), and 381 is the bit
size of the underlying finite field.</p>
<p>BLS12-381 was designed by the Zcash team, and has the simple equation
y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + 4.
It initially targetted a security level of 128 bits, but was later
estimated to offer less than 120 bits of security.</p>
<p>Besides Zcash, BLS12-381 is used in other projects&rsquo; zero-knowledge
proofs as well as in some BLS signatures, such as those of Ethereum 2.0.</p>

<h2 id="confusion">Confusion</h2>
<p>Cryptographically strong propagation of changes from an input throughout
the computation of a hash function&rsquo;s or block cipher&rsquo;s rounds.
If changes in (say) a given input bit don&rsquo;t affect some given output
bit, or if they do only with some statistical bias, then the algorithm
doesn&rsquo;t behave randomly and can be attacked by differential
cryptanalysis techniques.</p>
<p>Stacking confusion layers may never lead to a secure cipher if they
can&rsquo;t bring diffusion across all the state&rsquo;s bits.
For example, if AES only had S-boxes—the confusion-heavy
<code>SubBytes</code> operation)—a change in any Nth input byte would
only affect the Nth output byte.
Likewise, AES without <code>ShiftRows</code>—but with all other layers
including the column-wise diffusion layer <code>MixColumns</code>—then
differences would never propagate across rows of AES&rsquo;s 4×4-byte square
state.</p>
<p>See <em>Diffusion</em>.</p>
<h2 id="covert-channel">Covert channel</h2>
<p>Surreptitious transmission of information through a channel not intended
to transfer information of that sort or in that way, in order to evade
detection or analysis. Classes of covert channels include</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Storage channels, such as hiding data in innocuous-looking usage of
some network protocol (DNS is a popular choice), steganography
techniques, or social media services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timing channels, when for example a system&rsquo;s response time is use to
signal some information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behavior channels, where behavior patterns encode some information.
Port knocking can be seen as such a covert channel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Covert channels aren&rsquo;t much about cryptography. They don&rsquo;t hide the
communication content but the fact that communication happens at all.
They&rsquo;re thus useful in data exfiltration and communication between illegal
network operatives, for example.</p>

<h2 id="defi">DeFi</h2>
<p><em>De</em>centralized <em>F</em>raud on <em>i</em>nternet.</p>
<h2 id="diffusion">Diffusion</h2>
<p>Broad but cryptographically shallow propagation of changes from an input
throughout the computation of a hash function&rsquo;s or block cipher&rsquo;s
rounds.</p>
<p>See <em>Confusion</em>.</p>
<h2 id="distributed-password-authenticated-symmetric-key-encryption-dpase">Distributed password-authenticated symmetric key encryption (DPaSE)</h2>
<p>Protocol involving multiple servers to allow a user to encrypt and
decrypt data with keys derived from a single password in a way that
prevents offline password guessing hides plaintext and ciphertext from
the servers.
There is an additional operational cost to run the associated
infrastructure and mitigate DoS risks.</p>
<h2 id="eth2">Eth2</h2>
<p>Ethereum 2.0, the 3-phase evolution of Ethereum towards a more scalable
platform, with</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work, eliminating the energy
hungriness of the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chain sharding, which splits the blockchain into smaller chains that
work in parallel to process transactions more efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new virtual machine using a variant of WebAssembly, allowing
smart contracts to be coded in languages such as JavaScript and Rust.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fortuna">Fortuna</h2>
<p>A pseudorandom generator that was notably used in Microsoft
Windows and later in macOS.
Fortuna includes entropy pools and a reseed mechanism to provide
post-compromise security before the term &ldquo;post-compromise security&rdquo;
existed.</p>

<h2 id="galois">Galois</h2>
<p>French Mathematician Évariste Galois died in a gun duel at the age of 20, in 1832, after pioneering the study of finite fields.
The night before the duel he wrote a long letter to a friend about his
latest research, concluding by asking his friend to ask &ldquo;Jacobi or
Gauss&rdquo; their opinion and concluded «il y aura, j&rsquo;espère, des gens qui
trouveront leur profit à déchiffrer tout ce gâchis.»</p>
<h2 id="hopmac">HopMAC</h2>
<p>A member from the Keccak family missing from our first edition&rsquo;s
inventory. HopMAC is to KangrarooTwelve (K12) what HMAC is to SHA-2: a MAC
construction from a hash function, which does <code>HopMAC(K, M, C) =
K12(K, K12(M, C))</code>, where the inner K12 call returns a 256-bit hash
and the outer returns an arbitrary length hash. The parameter
<code>C</code> is a &ldquo;customization string&rdquo;, support as a second argument
of K12.</p>
<h2 id="key-commitment">Key commitment</h2>
<p>The property of authenticated encryption that a ciphertext requires the
correct key to decrypt to a valid plaintext.</p>

<h2 id="mov-attack">MOV attack</h2>
<p>A technique to solve a seemingly hard elliptic-curve discrete logarithm
problem by solving a discrete logarithm in an integer multiplicative
group and translating the solution back to elliptic-curve land.</p>
<p>This only works for certain curves (the <em>supersingular</em> ones).</p>

<h2 id="multi-signature">Multi-signature</h2>
<p>Collective signature schemes often implemented on-chain (typically via
Bitcoin scripts, or smart contracts), whose difference with threshold
signatures is that they reveal the identities of individual signers.</p>
<h2 id="nym-server">Nym server</h2>
<p>Short for pseudonymous remailer server.<br>
Nym servers serve to send pseudonymous email by relaying email messages
stripped off headers to hide the initial sender, and including an
identifier called a nym identity, along with a signature from that
identity.<br>
Emails are encrypted between remailers, and reach their final recipient
in clear or encrypted, but always signed by the pseudonymous identity.</p>

<h2 id="pss-probabilistic-signature-scheme">PSS (probabilistic signature scheme)</h2>
<p>Signature scheme designed to develop randomized, provably-secure RSA
signatures, standardized in PKCS#1 v2.1.
But RSA-PSS is about as secure as the simplistic deterministic full
domain hash (RSA-FDH), even when PSS is not randomized.</p>
<h2 id="rot13">ROT13</h2>
<p>Military-grade encryption, if you live in the year -60 BC.</p>
<h2 id="sextnfs-special-extender-tower-nfs">SexTNFS (special extender tower NFS)</h2>
<p>A variant of the number field sieve (NFS) algorithm to compute discrete
logarithms, found to reduce the security level of
Barreto&ndash;Naehrig (BN) curves from approximately 128 to 110 bits.
This observation prompted the Zcash project to switch to another curve,
BLS12-381, whose estimated 128-bit security level was later slightly
downgraded as well.</p>

<h2 id="template-attack">Template attack</h2>
<p>A class of power analysis attacks where the attacker can first play with
the attacked device, controlling all values including secret keys, in
order to built a statistical model of the correlations between values
and measurements.
The actual attack then leverages this model, or template, to extract
information from physical measurements.</p>

<h2 id="yarrow">Yarrow</h2>
<p>A pseudorandom generator that was notably used in Apple&rsquo;s OSX/macOS
until Apple replaced it by its successor Fortuna.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yarrow is a owering perennial with distintive at ower heads and lay leaves, like Queen Anne&rsquo;s Lae or wild arrot. Yarrow stalks have been used for divination in China sine the Hsia dynasty, in the seond millennium B.C.E. The fortuneteller would divide a set of 50 stalks into piles, then repeatedly use modulo arithmetic to generate two bits of random information (but with a nonuniform distribution)</p>
